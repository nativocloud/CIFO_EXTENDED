# Summary of Solution Representations Found

Based on the review of `main_script.py` and `solution.py`, two distinct solution representations for the Sports League Assignment Problem have been identified:

1.  **Player-assignment Representation (Linear Encoding):**
    *   **Description:** This representation uses a list (or vector) where each index corresponds to a player, and the value at that index is the ID of the team to which the player is assigned. For example, if there are 35 players, the assignment would be a list of 35 integers, where each integer is a team ID (e.g., 0 to 4).
    *   **Implementation Status:** This is the representation **currently implemented** in the project. The `LeagueSolution` class in `solution.py` uses `self.assignment` to store this list.
    *   **Details in `main_script.py`:** This is referred to as "B. Player-assignment Representation (Linear Encoding)" in the script, with a formal definition provided.

2.  **Team-based Representation (Structured Encoding):**
    *   **Description:** This representation would directly define which players belong to which team. It could be conceptualized as a list of teams, where each team is itself a list of player IDs or player objects. For example, a list of 5 teams, and each team sub-list contains 7 player identifiers.
    *   **Implementation Status:** This representation is **described conceptually** in `main_script.py` but is **not implemented** in the current codebase (`solution.py` or other Python files).
    *   **Details in `main_script.py`:** This is referred to as "A. Team-based Representation (Structured Encoding)" in the script, with a formal definition provided (A: P -> T).

The "second representation" you inquired about likely refers to this **Team-based Representation (Structured Encoding)**, which is documented but not the one actively used in the algorithms.

The next steps will involve analyzing the validity and applicability of this Team-based Representation for the league assignment problem and comparing it to the current Player-assignment implementation.
