    - Mention of the algorithms to be explored: Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms.
    - Structure of the report.

## 2. Problem Statement: Sports League Optimization
    - Detailed description of the fantasy sports league problem.
    - Objective: Create a balanced league by minimizing the standard deviation of average team skill ratings.
    - Constraints:
        - Team composition (1 GK, 2 DEF, 2 MID, 2 FWD per team).
        - Each player assigned to exactly one team.
        - Total team budget (<= 750M â‚¬ million per team).
        - Invalid configurations (not part of the search space).
    - Dataset description (players with name, position, skill, salary; 5 teams of 7 players each).

## 3. Formal Problem Definition (for Genetic Algorithms, and adaptable for HC/SA)
    - **Individual Representation:** How a solution (league configuration) is encoded.
    - **Search Space:** The set of all possible valid league configurations.
    - **Fitness Function:** How the quality of a solution is measured (standard deviation of average team skills, handling of budget violations).

    ### 4.1. Hill Climbing (HC)
        - Description of the HC algorithm as applied to the problem.
        - Neighborhood definition.
        - Search strategy.
    ### 4.2. Simulated Annealing (SA)
        - Description of the SA algorithm as applied to the problem.
        - Cooling schedule.
        - Acceptance probability.
    ### 4.3. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
        - **Selection Mechanisms:** Detailed description of at least 2 implemented selection mechanisms (new or adapted).
        - **Genetic Operators:**
            - **Crossover Operators:** Detailed description of at least 2 implemented crossover operators (new or adapted), with illustrations if helpful.
            - **Mutation Operators:** Detailed description of at least 3 implemented mutation operators (new or adapted), with illustrations if helpful.
        - Overall GA procedure (population initialization, evolution loop, termination criteria).

## 5. Experimental Setup
    - Parameters used for each algorithm (e.g., population size, generations, mutation/crossover rates for GA; initial temperature, cooling rate for SA; number of iterations for HC).
    - Metrics for performance evaluation (e.g., best fitness found, convergence speed, solution quality).
    - Computational environment.

## 6. Performance Analysis and Results
    - Comparison of the implemented algorithms (HC, SA, GA).
    - Analysis of the performance of different GA configurations (e.g., impact of different operators, selection mechanisms, elitism).
    - Visualizations (e.g., convergence plots, distribution of team skills for best solutions).
    - Discussion of the results obtained.

## 7. Justification of Decisions and Discussion
    - **Representation Choice:** Why the chosen individual representation is suitable.
    - **Fitness Function Design:** How the fitness function was designed to guide the search and handle constraints.
    - **Best Configurations:** Which algorithm configurations performed best and how they were evaluated.
    - **Operator Influence:** How different genetic operators (and their parameters) influenced convergence and solution quality.
    - **Elitism:** Discussion on the use of elitism in GA and its impact.
    - **Challenges Encountered:** Any difficulties faced during implementation or experimentation.
