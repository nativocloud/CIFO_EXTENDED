# Detailed Quantitative Analysis of CIFO EXTENDED Project Algorithms

**Date:** May 15, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document presents a detailed quantitative analysis of the performance of meta-heuristic algorithms explored within the CIFO EXTENDED project. The main objective is to provide a robust numerical foundation, including comparative convergence data, execution times, and statistical observations, to support the discussions and conclusions presented in the project's final reports. The analysis covers the various experimentation phases, from single-processor executions to multiprocessing optimizations and parameter variations, culminating in the identification of the most efficient and consistent algorithmic configurations for the sports team selection problem.

Key metrics such as best fitness achieved, mean fitness, fitness standard deviation (as a consistency indicator), and mean execution time will be examined. These data will be extracted from summaries generated throughout the project, allowing for a direct and informed comparison between the different approaches and configurations tested.

## 2. Quantitative Analysis Methodology

The quantitative analysis is based on summary data collected and stored in CSV files during the various project phases. The main metrics considered for each algorithm and configuration are:

*   **Overall Best Fitness:** The optimal fitness value (in this case, the lowest value of the objective function, which represents the variance of the mean skill between teams) found across all executions of a given configuration.
*   **Mean Fitness:** The average of the best fitness values obtained in each of the multiple executions of a configuration. This metric indicates the typical expected performance of the algorithm.
*   **Fitness Standard Deviation (Std Dev Fitness):** A measure of the algorithm's variability or consistency in achieving quality solutions. Lower values indicate greater consistency.
*   **Mean Execution Time (Mean Exec Time):** The average time, in seconds, that each execution of an algorithmic configuration took to complete.

The data will be presented in comparative tables, and references will be made to convergence graphs and other visual artifacts generated by the project to illustrate the behavior of the algorithms. The discussion will focus on interpreting these data to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, justifying the choices made throughout the project and the final recommendations.

Although formal statistical tests (such as ANOVA or t-tests) were not the primary focus of the original script execution for all intermediate comparisons, the analysis of results from 30 executions for promising algorithms and parameter variations allows for statistical inferences based on the observation of means, standard deviations, and the consistency with which optima are achieved. The "Statistical Analysis" sections in the phase reports already address these observations.

## 3. Quantitative Results and Discussion

In this section, we will present the key quantitative data from the different project phases.



### 3.1. Multiprocessing Phase - 5 Executions

In this initial multiprocessing phase, each algorithm/configuration was executed 5 times for a first assessment of its consistency and performance. The summarized results are presented below:

**Discussion (5 Executions):**

It is observed that Simulated Annealing and GA_Config_4 were able to achieve the best known fitness (0.057143) with perfect consistency (standard deviation of 0.0) already in this 5-execution phase. Hill Climbing, although very fast (0.47s), showed a higher mean fitness and some variability. GA_Config_2 and GA_Config_3 were significantly slower and less consistent. GA_Config_1, although faster than GA_Config_2 and 3, also did not demonstrate the same consistency as SA or GA_Config_4. These initial results already pointed to the superiority of SA and GA_Config_4 in terms of solution quality and consistency, and HC in terms of speed.


### 3.2. Multiprocessing Phase - 30 Executions with Promising Algorithms

After selecting the most promising algorithms (Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, GA_Config_1, and GA_Config_4) based on the 5-execution results, they were subjected to 30 executions for a more robust statistical analysis. The summarized results are:

| Algorithm                                                       | Mean Fitness       | Std Dev Fitness | Mean Exec Time (s) | Overall Best Fitness | Mutation Op                          | Crossover Op                     | Selection Op                      |

**Discussion (Initial 30 Executions):**

With 30 executions, it is observed that Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and GA_Config_4 showed very similar performance in terms of mean fitness (approximately 0.06046) and standard deviation (approximately 0.0124). All managed to achieve the overall best fitness of 0.057143. GA_Config_1 continued to show a slightly higher mean fitness and greater variability. In terms of time, Hill Climbing remained the fastest (0.63s), followed by GA_Config_1 (5.97s), GA_Config_4 (8.30s), and finally, Simulated Annealing (18.21s). These results reinforced the efficiency of Hill Climbing and the good performance of GA_Config_4, leading to their selection, along with GA_Config_1 (due to its speed among GAs), for the parameter variation phase. Simulated Annealing was discarded at this stage due to its comparative slowness without a clear gain in solution quality over HC or GA_Config_4 in these 30 executions with base parameters.


### 3.3. Parameter Variation Phase - 30 Executions per Variation

In this crucial phase, the Hill Climbing, GA_Config_1, and GA_Config_4 algorithms were subjected to a detailed analysis by varying their main hyperparameters. Each of the 19 resulting configurations was executed 30 times to ensure statistical robustness. The objective was to identify the optimal configurations for each algorithm.

The summarized results of this phase are presented in the following table:

| Algorithm                                 | Mean Fitness         | Std Dev Fitness | Mean Exec Time (s) | Overall Best Fitness | Parameters                               | Mutation Op                          | Crossover Op                     | Selection Op                      |

**Discussion (Parameter Variation):**

*   **Hill Climbing (HC):** The `HC_MaxIter_500` configuration stood out as ideal, achieving the best fitness (0.057143) with perfect consistency (practically null standard deviation) and the lowest execution time among all HC variations (0.44s). Increasing iterations did not improve solution quality and, in some cases, worsened mean fitness, suggesting rapid convergence.

*   **GA_Config_1:** The `GA_Config_1_mutation_rate_0.25` (Pop=50, Gen=100, MutRate=0.25) and `GA_Config_1_population_size_75` (Pop=75, Gen=100, MutRate=0.1) variations were the best, both achieving a mean fitness of 0.057143 with perfect consistency. The former was faster (6.25s vs 9.04s).

*   **GA_Config_4:** The `GA_Config_4_mutation_rate_0.15` (Pop=50, Gen=100, MutRate=0.15), `GA_Config_4_mutation_rate_0.25` (Pop=50, Gen=100, MutRate=0.25), and `GA_Config_4_population_size_75` (Pop=75, Gen=100, MutRate=0.1) variations were the top performers, all achieving a mean fitness of 0.057143 with perfect consistency. Of these, `GA_Config_4_mutation_rate_0.15` was the fastest (8.67s).

**General Conclusions from Parameter Variation:**

The results demonstrate that, with parameter optimization, both Hill Climbing and the two Genetic Algorithm configurations can consistently achieve the best-known solution (fitness of 0.057143). `HC_MaxIter_500` remains the fastest option by a significant margin. Among the optimized GAs, `GA_Config_1_mutation_rate_0.25` is slightly faster than `GA_Config_4_mutation_rate_0.15`, both offering excellent quality and consistency. The final choice will depend on the balance between execution time and the need for broader exploration of the solution space that GAs provide.

## 4. Conclusions of the Quantitative Analysis

The quantitative analysis of the results obtained throughout the various phases of the CIFO EXTENDED project allows for important conclusions about the performance and suitability of the tested meta-heuristic algorithms for the problem of balanced sports team formation.

1.  **Consistency in Achieving the Best Solution:** Several algorithmic configurations, namely `HC_MaxIter_500`, and the optimized versions of `GA_Config_1` (with a mutation rate of 0.25 or population size of 75) and `GA_Config_4` (with a mutation rate of 0.15 or 0.25, or population size of 75), demonstrated the ability to consistently achieve the best known fitness of **0.057143** (practically null fitness standard deviation) after 30 executions. This indicates that, with the correct parameters, these algorithms are robust in finding the identified optimal solution.

2.  **Efficiency of Hill Climbing:** The Hill Climbing algorithm, specifically with 500 iterations (`HC_MaxIter_500`), consistently stood out as the most efficient in terms of execution time. It managed to find the best solution in approximately **0.44 seconds** on average, a fraction of the time required by Genetic Algorithms, even in their optimized configurations.

3.  **Performance of Optimized Genetic Algorithms:** The optimized configurations of Genetic Algorithms (`GA_Config_1_mutation_rate_0.25` and `GA_Config_4_mutation_rate_0.15`) also achieved the best fitness with perfect consistency. However, their mean execution times were significantly higher (approximately **6.25 seconds** and **8.67 seconds**, respectively). Although slower than HC, GAs offer a potentially broader exploration mechanism of the solution space, which can be advantageous in more complex problems or with more deceptive fitness landscapes.

4.  **Impact of Parameter Variation:** The parameter variation phase was crucial for identifying configurations that maximize GA performance. It was observed that higher mutation rates (e.g., 0.15 or 0.25 for GA_Config_1 and GA_Config_4) and larger population sizes (e.g., 75) tend to improve solution quality and consistency, albeit at the cost of execution time. The number of generations also had a positive influence, but the impact of mutation rate and population size seemed more determinant in achieving optimal fitness with consistency.

5.  **Simulated Annealing:** Although Simulated Annealing showed good consistency in the initial phases (5 executions), its relatively high execution time (about 18 seconds in the 30-execution phase with base parameters) without offering better solution quality compared to optimized HC or optimized GAs, justified its exclusion from the final parameter variation phase for this specific problem.

In summary, the quantitative analysis supports the conclusion that `HC_MaxIter_500` is the most pragmatic choice for this problem if speed is a priority and the known optimal solution is satisfactory. If a more diverse exploration of the solution space is desired, with the guarantee of achieving the best fitness, the optimized configurations of `GA_Config_4` (with a mutation rate of 0.15) or `GA_Config_1` (with a mutation rate of 0.25) are viable alternatives, albeit more time-consuming. These data provide a solid basis for the recommendations presented in the project's final report.
