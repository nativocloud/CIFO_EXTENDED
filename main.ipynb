    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This work presents a constrained combinatorial optimization approach to the **Sports League Assignment Problem** using **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)**. The objective is to allocate a fixed pool of professional players into a set of 5 structurally valid teams in such a way that the **standard deviation of the teams\\\\\\\\' average skill ratings** is minimized—promoting competitive balance across the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player is defined by three attributes: **position** (one of `GK`, `DEF`, `MID`, `FWD`), **skill rating** (a numerical measure of ability), and **cost** (in million euros). A valid solution must satisfy the following **hard constraints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each team must consist of exactly **7 players**, with a specific positional structure: **1 GK, 2 DEF, 2 MID, and 2 FWD**\n",
    "- Each team must have a **total cost ≤ 750 million €**\n",
    "- Each player must be assigned to **exactly one team** (no overlaps)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **search space** is therefore highly constrained and discrete, and infeasible configurations are explicitly excluded from the solution space. The optimization objective is to identify league configurations where teams are not only valid but also **skill-balanced**, quantified by the **standard deviation of average skill ratings across teams**, which serves as the **fitness function** (to be minimized).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we implement a domain-adapted **Genetic Algorithm framework** featuring:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A custom **representation** based on team-to-player mappings\n",
    "- Validity-preserving **mutation** and **crossover** operators\n",
    "- Multiple **selection mechanisms**\n",
    "- Optional **elitism** and population-level diversity handling\n",
    "\n",
    "This report provides a formal problem definition, details the design of the solution encoding and operators, and presents empirical results comparing different GA configurations. The overall objective is to evaluate how well GA-based metaheuristics can navigate this complex constrained search space and evolve solutions that both satisfy domain constraints and optimize league balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Genetic Algorithms, this project also explores and evaluates alternative optimization strategies, such as **Hill Climbing** and **Simulated Annealing**, which are well-suited for navigating discrete and constrained search spaces. These algorithms offer different trade-offs in terms of exploration, exploitation, and convergence speed. By implementing and benchmarking multiple approaches on the same problem, we aim to gain deeper insights into their relative effectiveness and robustness when applied to complex constrained optimization tasks such as the Sports League Assignment. This comparative analysis enhances the interpretability of results and supports a broader understanding of the strengths and limitations of population-based versus local search-based heuristics."

    "\n",
    "**Key Observations (Example - will be updated based on actual results):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Solution Quality (Mean Fitness & Overall Best):** Generally, Genetic Algorithms (especially Config X and Y) are expected to find better (lower fitness) solutions on average compared to Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing. The overall best fitness achieved across all runs will also likely come from one of the GA configurations.\n",
    "*   **Consistency (Std Dev Fitness):** The standard deviation of fitness will indicate how consistently each algorithm performs. Lower standard deviation is preferable, suggesting more reliable results across different runs. Some GA configurations might show more consistency than others, or even SA.\n",
    "*   **Computational Cost (Mean Exec Time):** Hill Climbing is expected to be the fastest. Simulated Annealing will likely be slower than HC but faster than GAs. Genetic Algorithms, due to their population-based nature and multiple generations, will be the most computationally intensive.\n",
    "*   **Impact of GA Operators:** The comparison between different GA configurations will highlight which combinations of mutation, crossover, and selection operators were most effective for this specific problem. For instance, does a particular crossover strategy paired with a specific selection mechanism yield significantly better results?\n",
    "*   **Trade-offs:** The results will illustrate the classic trade-off between solution quality and computational effort. While GAs might provide the best solutions, their longer execution times might be a factor in practical applications.\n",
    "*   **Effectiveness of Multi-Run Hill Climbing:** Running HC multiple times from different starting points should provide a more robust baseline compared to a single run. The mean and best HC results will give a better sense of what a simple local search can achieve.\n",
    "*   **Simulated Annealing Performance:** SA should outperform HC by being able to escape local optima. Its performance relative to GAs will be a key point of comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The convergence plots for the best run of each algorithm (HC, SA, and each GA config) will show how quickly they approach their best solutions.\n",
    "*   The error bars in the mean fitness plot will visually represent the consistency of each algorithm."
